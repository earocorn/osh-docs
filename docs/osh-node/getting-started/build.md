# How to Build an OSH Node

This page guides you through building an OSH Node from source using the command line.

## Getting the Code
The git command is used to download the code from the GitHub repositories. 

For example, you can download the code for an OSH Node Development Template using the following command:

```git 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-node-dev-template.git
```

:::note
You need to use the "--recursive" option on this repository because it contains submodules
:::

## Building from the Command Line
You can the build the code from source using Gradle on the command line.

Change into the directory where you cloned the repository:

```cmd
$ cd {your-saved-location}/osh-node-dev-template
```
To build run:   
```gradle
$ ./gradlew build -x test
```
:::note
"-x test" excludes the tests from the build process 
:::



The resulting build will be contained in:

```/osh-node-template/build/distributions/osh-node-..*.zip```
