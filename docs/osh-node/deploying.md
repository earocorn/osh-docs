# Deploying an OSH Node

After building the node, you can navigate to the newly generated ``` /osh-node-template/build/distributions``` directory.

You will see the ```osh-node-..*.zip```

Unzip the node. Within the extracted folder execute the launch script for your corresponding OS by either double-clicking or running the script in the command line:
:::note

**Windows**: 

``` cmd 
./launch.bat
```
**Linux**:
``` cmd
 ./launch.sh
```
:::


Open your web browser and navigate to **localhost:8181/sensorhub/admin**
