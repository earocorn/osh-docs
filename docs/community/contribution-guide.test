# Contribute to OpenSensorHub

Want to become part of the OpenSensorHub community by adding functionality to the OpenSensorHub core or developing sensor adapters?

We welcome all developers interested in helping us build interoperable Sensor Webs and the Internet of Things. Most contributions are likely to be adapters for specific or general sensors and actuators. Additional development may involve:

- OSH Core (Java)
- OSH Client Toolkit (JavaScript)
- Processing support
- Security
- DevOps
- SensorML editors/viewers
- Integration with GeoServer, GeoNode, and other geospatial technologies

## Ways to Get Started

- Check out what has been done in the **Explore** and **Deploy** sections
- Watch the video demos and tutorials
- Browse the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSensorHub)
- Read the [deployment and development documentation](https://opensensorhub.github.io/)
- [Contact us](https://opensensorhub.github.io/contact/) and let us know what you’re up to. Perhaps we can help or point you in the right direction.
- For hardware-software interfacing, explore blogs like *Building GeoCam*, *Arduino Sensors*, etc.
