## Introduction
**OpenSensorHub (OSH)** is an open-source framework deisgned to build **interopable** and **evolutive** sensor networks. It leverages **open standards**, primarily from the **OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)** initiative, to facilitate scalable and reconfigurable sensor networks. This approach ensures that new sensor types can be easily integrated and network configurations can adapt over time.

## Key Features
- **Open Standards Compliance**: Supports OGC SWE standards for robust data exchange.
- **Flexible Sensor Connectivity**: Works with a wide range of interfaces, including:
  - **Wired**: RS232/422, SPI, I2C, USB, Ethernet
  - **Wireless**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, HTTP
- **Java-Based Framework**: Provides a simple, generic driver API to connect sensors and actuators to a **common bus**.
- **Command & Data Handling**: Once a driver is available, sensors are automatically connected, enabling seamless **data reading** and **command execution**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enables intuitive **network configuration** and management.
- **Advanced Processing Capabilities**: Supports **multi-threading** and distributed processing on powerful hardware setups.
- **Embedded System Support**:
  - Runs on **Java SE, Java ME, and Android**
  - Future plans include **C++ and Arduino** versions for microcontrollers
  - Wide client library support via **OSH-Connect**

## Web Services
OSH integrates **OGC web services**, such as:
- [**OGC API - Connected Systems**](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/connectedsystems/)
- [**Sensor Observation Service (SOS)**](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos) 
- [**Sensor Planning Service (SPS)**](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/sps/) 

These services enable multiple **SensorHub instances** to communicate, forming larger sensor networks that share metadata (e.g., ownership, location, orientation, calibration).

## Performance & Scalability
OSH is optimized for different hardware levels:
- **Embedded Systems**: Efficient low-level functions for devices running **Java ME**.
- **High-Performance Platforms**: Multi-threaded architecture leverages **multi-processor servers and clusters** for advanced data processing.
